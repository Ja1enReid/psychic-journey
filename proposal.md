# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Impossible Hangman

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A typical game of hangman, but with a twist the user(s) will never be able to solve the hangman.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project will allow the user to input a letter and if said letter is correct then it will fill in the the missing letter(s) on the the underlines. If the letter is incorrect then it will draw one of the parts of our “hangman” until he is fully drawn (8 guesses). This game will be put on a website which will include a reset button as well as a reveal button. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Having the game complete and playable in python. If it doesn’t make it to the website with all of the extras, I will still consider it a GOOD outcome. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Playable on the website, no extra buttons but on a website and playable.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Playable on the website and including all of the extra buttons, images and possibly sounds. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Web Design and Integrading the images and sound to correspond to the actions in the games as well as in the code.
